 <div id="aboutText">
   <p class="maintext">HAY was founded in 2002 and the furniture collection was launched at IMM Cologne in 2003. HAY's ambition is to encourage Danish furniture design’s return to the innovative greatness of the 1950’s and 1960’s in a contemporary context. 
     Today, ten years later that ambition has not changed! It is still a great inspiration and keeps us inspired and motivated every day in creating meaningful and sincere design.     </p>
   <p class="maintext">Through our commitment to the design and production of furniture and accessories with an international appeal HAY strives to make good design accessible by supplying our trademark designs with affordable price tags. HAY is committed to nurturing and promoting the originality of young talents as well as exploring the twisted minds of established designers.     </p>
   <p class="maintext">HAY always circles around architecture, sustainable design and high quality at affordable prices. In striving to design the perfect product, we embrace space, new technology, and society and seek to understand the grounds for modern life.     </p>
   <p class="maintext">HAY operates in the field between architecture and fashion bridging the statics from architecture and the dynamics from fashion.  We are ambitious in the field of innovation and the use of cutting edge technology.     </p>
   <p class="maintext">HAY collaborates with the most highly skilled and talented international designers who use new materials and modern technology to create products with enhanced value for the user.     </p>
   <p class="maintext">As a supplement to the furniture collection HAY has introduced an accessory and rug collection consisting of cushions, quilts, bedcovers, hangers etc. for modern homes. </p>
   <p class="maintext">In 2011 we launched the HAY Market collection inspired by market places around the world. The products we have found here have been redesigned to fit into a modern context. Common to these products is that they are simple and useful everyday products with a modern design. </p>
