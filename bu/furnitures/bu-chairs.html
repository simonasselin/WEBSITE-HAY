            <p class="maintext">The idea behind the About A Chair-collection has been to develop a chair with conspicuous simplicity. A chair which works just as well around the dining table as around a conference table, in a canteen or at the office. 
              
              The ambition of designer HAY and Hee Welling has been to combine form, function, comfort, detail and aesthetics.</p>
            <p class="maintext"> About A Chair is the product of close collaboration between Hee Welling and HAY aspiring to create a family of chairs where all shells and frames can be combined â€“ but where diversity is possible without compresing the perfection. </p>
