            <p class="maintext">The idea behind the About A Chair-collection has been to develop a chair with conspicuous simplicity. A chair which works just as well around the dining table as around a conference table, in a canteen or at the office. </p>
            <p class="maintext">The ambition of designer HAY and Hee Welling has been to combine form, function, comfort, detail and aesthetics.<br />
              About A Chair is the product of close collaboration between Hee Welling and HAY aspiring to create a family of chairs where all shells and frames can be combined – but where diversity is possible without compresing the perfection.<br />

            <p class="maintext">The philosophy behind the Hee Chairs was to take an archetypical chair and perfecting it in every single detail by lifting the design up a level, simplifying it and improving the usability. The starting point was to make a cool and basic chair that would fit most locations – modern but not so typical of the period, that it does not have a long life. There is nothing superfluous or ornamented about the chair and nothing can be removed without losing the function. The chair has a playful expression but does not let the design compromise the purpose.</p>
            <p class="maintext">The Hee chair is available as a lounge chair, a dining chair and a bar stool. It is, among other places being used such prominent places as the Oslo Opera and the Australian parliament. The chair is stackable and electroplated before being powder coated, and it withstands weather throughout the year making it suitable for outdoor use. Floor linking connection and cushions available. </p>

            <p class="maintext">J110 dining chair is part of HAY's 2011 relaunch of the Danish furniture classics originally made for FDB (The Danish Consumers’Co-operative Society). </p>
            <p class="maintext">Functionalist and democratic design for the people - that was the main idea behind the furniture production started by FDB in the 1940s. By shifting to industrial production and hereby decreasing the costs, FDB pushed forward the availability of designer furniture for average people, by making high quality design furniture at relatively low prices.</p>
            <p class="maintext">The J110 chair is designed by Poul M. Volther and is made from beech wood, natural wood and in 4 different colours. It has the same seat height as other dining chairs but because of the high back it bears a certain resemblance to a lounge chair.</p>
