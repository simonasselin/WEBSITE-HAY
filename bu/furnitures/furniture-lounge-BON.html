            <p class="maintext">What makes a sofa great is everything that cannot be seen – suspension, composition of the foam and durability of the upholstery. HAY Studio has given all of these components high priority when designing Mags. The high arm rests and deep seat make Mags ideal for relaxation. Its firm composition with no detachable cushions makes it flexible because cushions and blankets can be moved around according to preference.
The design philosophy behind the sofa Mags is that a sofa must have a simple design because it is visually dominant. However, simple designs demands perfection in every detail.
Because Mags is composed of modular units of different length as well as a corner, chaiselong and lounge module it can be designed to fit any room and need. Large button decor is optional.

            <p class="maintext">With this sofa we wanted to make a light sofa with soft rounded shapes to make it welcoming and informal while keeping it firm. From beginning to end the design process has been very “hands on” to get exactly the right shapes, curves and stitches. <br /> <br />
The slender frame contrasts the voluminous body and legs lifts the seats from the floor making it seem lighter. The armrests seem to hug the seat. Stitching has been minimized and each seat, backrest and armrest is upholstered in just one piece of fabric to make the edges soft and round. The base is made from extruded aluminum and available in chrome, powder coated or with upholstery in the same fabric as the sofa.
Bjørn is currently available as a 3-seater with two wide seats, but we are working on turning it into a modular system like Mags Sofa with chaiselong, pouf and lounge module.
Bjørn is a sofa suitable for contract as well as private market. </p>

            <p class="maintext">ONE is a collection of upholstered furniture that incorporates geometric and organic themes. The concept originates from an ambition to make something different, invent a new style and create a new idiom. The pieces in this collection are hollow, sculptural and monolithic unlike regular lounge furniture which is usually solid and placed on a base of metal or wood. With their monumental look they almost seem to become one with the floor. <br />

The shape of the furnitures in this collection is organically inspired, but yet commanded by an underlying geometry to maintain an optimal functionallity. 
An organically drawed outline in a controlled form - an artifice borrowed from architecture. </p>
